# The Side Effects of Microtransactions
This presentation was created, individualy, as an introduction to the class. This presentation was designed based on the format of a 6-slide presentation with the goal of convincing an audience of an idea, or side of some argument. 
# USABILITY TESTING FOR A SAAS APPLICATION IN HEALTHCARE
This presentation was developed with a 4 person team over the course of about 2 months. The idea behind the presentation was to present, in a business-like scenario, the reasons that usability testing should be used in the development of a Software as a Service (SaaS) application related to healthcare services. Specifically, this application would be used by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, so the usability of this application should be paramount in it's design process to best serve the people that rely on the department.
