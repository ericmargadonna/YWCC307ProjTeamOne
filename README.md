# The Side Effects of Microtransactions

This presentation was created for classwork for YWCC307 - Teamwork and Communication, Spring 2022 at NJIT. This presentation was designed based on the format of a 6-slide presentation with the goal of convincing the audience of some idea or side of an argument. Here, I presented my case for how microtransactions in video games have become too prevalent, and we need to shield people, especaially children, from what is essentially gambling.
